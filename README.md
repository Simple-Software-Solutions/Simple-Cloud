# SimpleCloud
# Introduction
SimpleCloud is a dockerised storage app which runs on your Masternodes. This enables you to utilise unused disk space on your nodes for file storage. 


# Requirements
Ubuntu 18.04 OS

2GB RAM (1GB may work but i did get a few memory leak errors when installing Simple Cloud from certain VPS Providers. If you experience the same issue I have created a document on how to add a 1GB Swap file which would allow you to install Simple Cloud)

# Installation
